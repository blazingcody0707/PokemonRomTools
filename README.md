# PokemonRomTools
A series of assorted tools used to analyse and translate 3rd gen Pok√©mon games.

This library consists of three major things

- tools to try and find text entries in a Pokemon rom
- a tool to translate those found entries
- a tool to apply the translations to a rom

No releases of any kind yet. This is currently too much in flux to be used from anything else than directly from Visual Studio.
